Tic-tac-toe game, but with a little twist: the size of the play field is configurable between 3x3 and 10x10. 
Also the symbols (usually O and X) are configurable. 
And also it should be for 3 players instead of just 2.

To play, first run ServerApplication and then two instances of ClientApplication.

Server url also can be configured.

The solution uses Swing as frontend and Spring Web Sockets as backend application.
